# PyTlang

A programming interpreted language created using Python. A fun little project.

To run a script written in tlang you need to type in the terminal:

    --> python tlang1.py name_of_file.tlang
    
You can also put -log in the end to get a full traceback: WARNING: -log is not currently supported

    --> python tlang1.py name_of_file.tlang -log
    
--version : to get the version of the interpreter

--docs : to get the full documentation of the pseudo-programming language

--help : to get the this page

## DOCUMENTATION

p() is for printing anything put inside will be printed

    p(Hello World)

## CONTRIBUTION:

WARNING: Code poorly optimized, and written like spaghetti. Please understand if I fix any issues considering optimazation or readability is going to happen ONLY because I need the language for a particular use for another project.

You may fork this project and add or optimise certain aspects of the code.

If you see any grammatical/syntax error you can contribute.
