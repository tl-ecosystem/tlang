# TLangPy
WARNING: Code poorly optimized, and written like spaghetti. The reason is because this project was supposed to be small, but accidently made it bigger than envisioned, which led to me writing poor code due to the short time. Please understand if I fix any issues considering optimazation or readability is going to happen ONLY because I need the language for a particular use for another project.

A pseudo-programming interpreted language created using Python. A fun little project.

To run a script written in tlang you need to type in the terminal:

    --> python tlang1.py name_of_file.tlang
    
You can also put -log in the end to get a full traceback: WARNING: -log is not currently supported

    --> python tlang1.py name_of_file.tlang -log
    
--version : to get the version of the interpreter

--docs : to get the full documentation of the pseudo-programming language
